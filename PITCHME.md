### Why Threat Model
@snapend

- Find security bugs early
- Helps drive-out Security Requirements
- Build better products
- Makes us think about Security!

Note:
- You may be thinking, why do I want to add more overhead to our process!
- SR: Is this necessary? Do we need to design for securing X?
- Driving out requirements and spotting bugs before we've written any code reduces re-work at later, more expensive, stages of dev.
