#### How Did We Do?
@snapend

@ul
- Does threat model represent system?
- Do we have threats and mitigations defined?
- These make great test cases! Even the mitigated ones.
  - Threat Modelling empowers Testing; Testing empowers Threat Modelling
- Have all the identified issues been addressed?
- Longer term, are we seeing less security bugs raised?

Note:
- Did we do a decent job of analysis
