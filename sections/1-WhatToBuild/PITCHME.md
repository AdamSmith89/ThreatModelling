Note:
- Suggest using a DFD. Familiar to most people. Problems/threats tend to follow the data flow. Allows you to focus attention on the important parts of the system.
- If data can go either one place or another, add both!
- Can split into multiple diagrams
- Not much different from a normal DFD
- Difficult to find all the threats
- Can we find any? Write them on a board!

Note:
- Show who controls what. Can be anything from physical locations to privilege levels on a single machine
- Trust Boundaries Helps you focus on where threats are likely to be found
- Sometimes known as Attack Surfaces
- This is the key difference between standard diagrams
- Any more threats that can be found?
