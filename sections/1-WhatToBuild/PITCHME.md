#### What Are We Building?
#### *Model the System*
@snapend

@ul
Basic DFD with components and links
What threats can you find?
@ulend

Note:
- If data can go either one place or another, add both!
- Not much different from a normal DFD
- Difficult to find all the threats
- Can we find any? Write them on a board!

#### What Are We Building?
#### *Trust Levels & Boundaries*
@snapend

@ul
Add trust boundaries to diagram
Can be anything from physical locations to privilege levels on a single machine
@ulend

Note:
- Trust Boundaries Helps you focus on where threats are likely to be found
- Show who controls what
- Sometimes known as Attack Surfaces
- This is the key difference between standard diagrams
