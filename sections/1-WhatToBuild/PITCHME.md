Note:
- DFD on a whiteboard tends to be the most productive
- Can transfer to an electronic copy later

### What to Model

Basic DFD with components and links

Note:
- Start with the components
- Add the flow of data
- If data can go either one place or another, add both!

### What to Model

Add trust boundaries
They show who controls what
Can be anything from physical locations to privilege levels on a single machine

Note:
- Sometimes known as Attack Surfaces
- Helps you focus on where threats are likely to be found
- This is the key difference between standard diagrams
